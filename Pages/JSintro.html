        JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.

Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.

it Can handle date and time and Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.it do not need any compiler.JavaScript on a webpage may
